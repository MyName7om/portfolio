## More About Me
I am a Computer Science undergraduate at Heriot Watt University with an excellent academic record and practical programming experience. In addition to my studies, I actively contribute to university life as a dedicated rugby team member. Furthermore, I referee and coach for a judo club. These activities have gained me valuable teamwork and leadership skills and boosted my confidence and communication abilities. I am eager to translate my hard work and dedication into a rewarding career in the software development industry, where I can continue to learn, collaborate, and excel.
